## Background of the CCUK project
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://www.uhbristol.nhs.uk/research-innovation/our-research/bristol-nutrition-bru/studies/cleft-care-uk/" target="_blank" title="Project webpage">
The Cleft Care UK (CCUK) project</a> is a study of the outcomes, treatment and management of 5 year old children born between 2005 and 2007 with non-syndromic Unilateral Cleft Lip and Palette (UCLP). The study took place 12 years after the publication of the 1998 CSAG report, which recommended that cleft services be reconfigured to a more centralised model and that core multi-disciplinary teams be established. The 57 centres operating on children with oro-facial clefting was ultimately reduced to 11 sites or managed clinical networks (hubs). We recently described the changes to treatment and outcomes that have occurred since centralisation. The purpose of this report is to provide feedback to each hub on their respective treatment indicators and outcomes, and to describe the variability in outcomes that exists between hubs.

## Methods
<p align="justify">
The data used to address these aims are from the CCUK project. CCUK is a cross-sectional study that was set up for the purpose of research. It recruited 268/359 (75%) of eligible five year olds born with UCLP. A wide range of information was collected from the routinely designated 5 year audit clinics. This was supplemented with additional information from questionnaires and medical records. The 26 variables presented in this report cover dental structure, facial appearance, oral health, audiology, speech and wellbeing. They were selected to capture key indicators of outcome or important aspects of care. Statistical modelling was done to describe the outcomes in each hub and quantify the extent of variation between hubs. The data for each particular centre are automatically addressed, organised and presented in a separate report, data from the other sites have been anonymised. These automatic processes have been performed using <strong>the CCUK-GenRep</strong> software.
